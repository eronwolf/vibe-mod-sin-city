      question: "What was Peter’s relationship like with your mom and Tom?",
      answer: "It was rocky… with both of them, but especially Tom. He never felt like he belonged in this family. Mom tried, I know she did, but Peter's pain ran deep. He’s been distant ever since they sold the shop and he found out he wasn’t getting anything."
    },
    {
      question: "How did Oliver get along with your parents?",
      answer: "Oliver’s always been… intense. They loved him, but he made it really hard sometimes. When they told him he wouldn’t be running the store, he exploded. We were all there—it got ugly. He thinks the shop was his birthright or something."
    },
    {
      question: "What can you tell me about Hank’s relationship with your parents?",
      answer: "Mom adored Hank. I think she saw something gentle in him. Dad… not so much. After the fire, everything changed. Dad accused him, publicly. But honestly? I don’t think Hank did it. I think it was Oliver."

    {
      question: "What do you know about the fire at the store?",
      answer: "It was awful. It happened late at night — Dad said Hank was already there, trying to put it out. But then Dad changed his mind and blamed him. I don’t know why. I always thought… it might’ve been Oliver. He was drinking a lot around then."
    },
    {
      question: "How did everyone take the news that the store was being sold?",
      answer: "It was hard. That shop was everything to Dad. But he and Mom were ready to move on. Peter didn’t care — he hadn’t been around. But Oliver… he was furious. Thought he deserved to take over, even though no one trusted him with it."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you know anything about your parents' will?",
      answer: "They updated it a few months ago. Me and Oliver were included. Peter wasn’t. It caused a lot of tension. Mom tried to soften it, but Peter saw it as just more proof they never wanted him."
