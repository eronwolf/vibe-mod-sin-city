          "Though known to many as co-owner of Wild Trail Supply Co., Carol Trembly carved her own legacy in the community as a gardener, baker, and quiet spiritual force. Her small-batch baked goods and seasonal produce were staples at the local farmer’s market, and many locals credit her warm energy and generosity as reasons they kept returning. “Carol didn’t just sell things,” said one vendor. “She gave people something to look forward to.”",
