      question: "What did you hear that day?",
      answer: "One shot. Clean. Carried all the way past the ridge. Then a woman cried out — sharp and scared. And not long after… a man yelled. Not loud, but like his guts dropped out."
    },
    {
      question: "Did you see anyone?",
      answer: "A figure, just past the cliff bend. Tall, wide-shouldered. Stood there starin’ down like he’d lost something. Couldn’t see his face, but his arm caught the light — looked like a bird inked in flight. Desert eagle, I call it."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you think it was someone from town?",
      answer: "Could’ve been. Or not. These woods have a memory, you know. Could’ve been a ghost. Could’ve been yesterday, walkin’ around in a man’s coat."
